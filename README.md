# Whop Funnel Builder

A comprehensive multi-tier funnel builder prototype for the Whop platform, designed to solve the validated user pain point of creating progressive offer funnels within a single product experience.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Through direct user research, I discovered that Whop creators face a critical limitation:

> *"ability to have multiple offers within one whop, so that i dont need to create 3 separate whops to complete my funnel (free -> private group -> full course)"* - Actual Whop User

Current users must create separate "whops" for each tier of their funnel (Free Community → Paid Group → Premium Course), resulting in:
- Fragmented customer experiences
- Complex funnel management across multiple products
- Reduced conversion rates due to friction between tiers
- Lost analytics visibility across the customer journey

## 💡 Solution

This prototype demonstrates a unified funnel builder that enables creators to design complete progressive customer journeys within a single Whop, featuring:

- **Multi-tier funnel creation** with seamless tier transitions
- **Advanced analytics dashboard** with growth insights
- **Revenue attribution** across funnel stages
- **Actionable recommendations** powered by performance data

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Growth Insights Engine
- **Automated opportunity detection**: Analyzes funnel performance and surfaces high-impact, actionable insights
- **Revenue impact estimation**: Each recommendation includes projected revenue and user growth
