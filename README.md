# Whop Funnel Builder

A multi-tier funnel builder prototype for the Whop platform, designed to solve the validated user pain point of creating progressive offer funnels within a single product experience.

## Problem Statement

Current Whop users need to create separate "whops" for each tier of their funnel (e.g., Free Community → Paid Group → Premium Course), resulting in fragmented customer experiences and complex management.

## Solution

This prototype demonstrates a unified funnel builder that allows creators to design progressive customer journeys within a single Whop, improving conversion rates and simplifying management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Whop design tokens
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Architecture**: Component-based with proper separation of concerns

## Development Phases

- [x] **Phase 1**: Design system and core layout matching Whop's interface
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Funnel creation interface and tier configuration
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Analytics dashboard and customer progression tracking

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
