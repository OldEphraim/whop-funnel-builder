# Whop Funnel Builder

A multi-tier funnel builder for Whop that solves a real user problem I discovered through research.

## The Problem

I reached out to actual Whop users and found this pain point:

> *"ability to have multiple offers within one whop, so that i dont need to create 3 separate whops to complete my funnel (free -> private group -> full course)"* - Actual Whop User

Right now, creators have to make separate whops for each tier of their funnel, which creates a fragmented experience and makes it hard to track performance across the whole customer journey.

## The Solution

This prototype lets creators build complete funnels within a single Whop. Instead of managing 3 separate products, they get one unified experience with:

- **Multi-tier funnel creation** - Build your entire customer journey in one place
- **Analytics dashboard** - See how customers move through your funnel
- **Growth insights** - Get actionable recommendations to improve performance
- **Revenue tracking** - Understand which tiers drive the most value

## Key Features

**Funnel Builder**: 3-step wizard to create funnels with multiple tiers, each with different pricing and Whop apps (Chat, Courses, etc.)

**Analytics Dashboard**: Visual funnel flow showing conversion rates between tiers, revenue breakdown, and performance metrics

**Growth Insights**: Automated recommendations like "Your free-to-paid conversion is 23.6% (above 15% industry average) - consider increasing free tier value"

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with Whop design tokens
- Vite for development
- Jest for testing

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Demo Highlights

The prototype includes realistic mock data showing:
- A trading program funnel with 23.6% conversion rate
- Revenue split analysis between tiers
- Actionable growth recommendations with estimated impact

## Why This Matters

**For Creators**: Higher conversion rates through unified funnels, better analytics, simpler management

**For Whop**: Increased user retention, more platform stickiness, competitive advantage
